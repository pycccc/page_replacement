Page Replacement Algorithms and Evaluation

## Implement four algorithms for comparison:
* FIFO algorithm
* Optimal algorithm
* Enhanced second-chance algorithm
* My own algorithm

## Three test reference strings to evaluate performance:
* Random: Arbitrarily pick one number for each reference.
* Locality: Simulate procedure calls. The reference string length of each procedure
call accounts for 1/200-1/100 of the overall reference string length. Note that the
length shall be random.
* My own reference string
